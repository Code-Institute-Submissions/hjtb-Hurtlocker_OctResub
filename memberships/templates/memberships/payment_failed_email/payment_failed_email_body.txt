Hi {{ email_data.first_name }}, 

We are just letting you know that we have put your membership on hold for the minute. 

We attempted to collect your subscription at {{ email_data.last_payment }} but it failed.

This could be as a result of a card expiry or other error.

If you would like to resubscribe just head over and log back in and resubscribe again.

Alternatively you can manage your subscription using the following link:
{{ email_data.customer_portal_url }}

Hope to see you soon,

The Hurtlocker Crew.
