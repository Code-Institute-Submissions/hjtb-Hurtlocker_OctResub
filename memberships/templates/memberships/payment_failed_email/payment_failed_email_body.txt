Hi {{ email_data.first_name }}, 

We are just letting you know that we have put your membership on hold for the minute. 

We attempted to collect your subscription at {{ email_data.last_payment }} but it failed.

This could be as a result of a card expiry or other error.

If you would like to resubscribe just head over and log back in and resubscribe again.

Hope to see you soon,

The Hurtlocker Crew.
