## **Goal for this project** 

Welcome to Hurtlocker Sports Club.

The goal of this project is to create a web application for a sports club so that they can recruit new members and securely, and easily accept subscriptions from members. The app will provide members with information regarding the club and its activities. Users will be able to browse the different activity types and make bookings when they have purchased a membership subscription. When they purchase a subscription they will receive a list of the upcoming events associated with their membership and in turn will be able to make bookings and attend the sessions.

The app was deployed using Heroku and can be found here: [Hurtlocker](https://hurtlocker-jtb.herokuapp.com/)

## **UX**

### **Site Objectives**

#### **Hurtlocker assists club owners by:**

1. Providing a platform to publicise the club and in turn assists with recruiting new members and collecting subscriptions from them.
2. Serving as a place where the club can display basic info about the club, its activities and schedules.
3. EThe app will also allow staff members of the club schedule sessions and make them available for booking.


#### **Hurtlocker assists users and members by:**

1. Providing a platform for them to see what activities are available and what benefits subscribing would have.
2. Enabling users to sign up and easily pay for their subscriptions.
3. Presenting useful information to members regarding the club, its activities and schedule.
4. Allows paid members to book activities through the site and in turn attend the sessions.

### **User Stories**

**As a user:**

I want to be able to create an account
I want to view the various activities the club caters for and what a membership allows me to do.  
I want to sign up for membership and pay for it securely.  
I want to see more in depth information regarding the clubs activities and schedule.
I want to book activities.  
I want to view my upcoming bookings for activities and cancel if needs be.  
I want to create a profile for my user and customize it accordingly.  
I want to cancel my subscription if I need to.   
I want to view my subscription end date/renewal.

**As an admin:**

I want to see subscribers to the club and when they are subscribed until  
I want to update the activity information and add,edit and delete new activities and update their schedules.  
I want to see which members have booked which activities.  

### **Design Choices**

I spent a lot of time initially thinking about the design of the website for Hurtlocker.  
I went for darker colors of black and dark red along with a slightly mustard yellow to make things stand out a bit.  
The theme fits that of a martial arts gym.  

#### **Fonts** 
I used Google Fonts to explore the various options available and went for some basic clean fonts.  
For the titles and subtitles, I went with the font Righteous and for the main text I have used Roboto Condensed.

#### **Icons**

I used [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) for the logo and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for all other icons throughout.  

#### **Colors**

I utilised Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to pick the colors for the site.  
The site hero image had a lot of red and black so I decided to stick with that sort of theme.

![Coolors Color Scheme](readme_images/coolers-hurtlocker.png)

#### **Structure**

The site is structured in such a way that users can find relevant information, subscribe and make bookings easily.   
The three main sections being the initial landing and club page, the activities section and the profiles section.  
The navbar at the top makes navigating the site easy and there are various handy links throw in relevant places also.  

#### **Data Model**

The data model was quite a simple one with most relationships being one to many other than the bookings table.  
Overall it didn't take much time to implement this and Django models really made it very quick.

## **Deployment**

To get the app deployed to Heroku, I took the following steps:

1. Navigated to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) and signed in
2. Created an app by clicking New in the top right and then create new app
3. Named the app and select the region closest to you
4. In the Resources tab, selected Heroku Postgres and chose a plan
5. Ensured that dj_database_url is installed by typing ```pip3 install dj_database_url``` in the terminal
6. Also installed ```pip3 install psycopg2-binary```
7. Froze all the requirements with ```pip freeze > requirements.txt```
8. Navigated to the Settings tab on the Heroku site for the app, clicked on Reveal Config Vars and copied the ```DATABASE_URL``` value
9. Pasted the url from step 8 into the ```os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "url_pasted_here")``` in my ```env.py``` file
10. Dumped all my test data I had input (users, workouts, and pictures) into a json file with a command in the terminal: ```./manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes > db.json```
12. Updated my ```settings.py``` file by commenting out the ```DATABASES``` section and adding the following block of code - 
    ```
    DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))}
    ```
12. In the terminal, I ran ```python3 manage.py migrate```
13. Uploaded the json file from step 10 to the Postgres database with ```./manage.py loaddata db.json```
14. Created another superuser so I could log in - ```python3 manage.py createsuperuser```
15. Installed Gunicorn to act as the web server - ```pip3 install gunicorn``` and repeated step 7
16. Created the Procfile to ensure that Heroku could create a web dyno to serve the app
17. Temporarily disabled collect static with the terminal command ```heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app overreach``` - this appeared in the Heroku Config Vars
18. Added the hostname of the Heroku app to ```ALLOWED_HOSTS``` in ```settings.py```
19. Pushed the repository to Github
20. Navigated to the Deploy tab in Heroku and selected Connect to Github
21. Enabled automatic deploys from the master branch of the repository

### **AWS S3**

After the above steps I needed to get Amazon S3 set up to store static files and images. This is the process I followed:

1. Created an account on [Amazon AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/)
2. Searched the services available for [S3](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/)
3. Created a new bucket that was set to be public
4. Turned on static website hosting for that bucket
5. Input the required CORS configuration - 
    ```
    [
        {
            "AllowedHeaders": [
                "Authorization"
            ],
            "AllowedMethods": [
                "GET"
            ],
            "AllowedOrigins": [
                "*"
            ],
            "ExposeHeaders": []
        }
    ]
    ```
6. Created a bucket policy with the generator provided by S3 and pasted it into the bucket policy editor
7. Ensured that there was access to all objects for everyone in the public access section
8. Navigated to Amazon's Identity and Access Management
9. Created a Group for management of the Overreach app and a pre-built AWS policy for that group
10. Pasted the ARN from the Amazon bucket into the Group policy to allow that group access
11. Asigned the correct Group policy to the Overreach management Group
12. Created a user for the Group and gave that user full access
13. Downloaded the CSV file containing the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
14. Saved the keys from step 13 to my ```env.py``` file and Heroku Config Vars and also added another varible in Heroku only - ```USE_AWS``` set to ```True```
15. Removed the ```DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC``` variable from Heroku Config Vars
16. In the terminal of my workspace, I installed boto3 and django-storages
17. I also added the following block of code to ```settings.py``` -- 
    ```python
    if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:

    # Cache control
    AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
        'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
        'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
    }

    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'hurtlocker-jtb'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-west-1'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

    # Static and media files
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

    # Override static and media URLs in production
    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
    ```
    -- this was to ensure that in production, Django would upload all the static files to S3 as well as cache the static files for faster performance for the user
18. Created ```custom_storages.py``` and used the classes from django-storage 
19. Commited all the changes and pushed to Github - Heroku then built the app and everything from ```/static``` was uploaded successfully to S3

The final key step in deployment was to ensure that users could receive emails for various notifications regarding signing up, payment and membership cancellations.

The ```webhook_handler.py``` file in the memberships app takes care of this, but the following lines below were added to the ```settings.py``` file:

```python
if 'EMAIL_HOST_USER' in os.environ:
    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
    EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
    EMAIL_PORT = 587
    EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_USER')
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_PASS')
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'info@hurtlocker.com'
else:
    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'info@hurtlocker.com'
```

In Gmail, I created an app password for the Django app and input the 16 digit password into the Heroku Config Vars with the name ```EMAIL_HOST_PASS```, corresponding to the clip from ```settings.py``` above. Also, in Heroku, ```EMAIL_HOST_USER``` was set as my own email address in Config Vars.

### **Running Locally**

The project was created in Gitpod and the repository is stored at Github. If you would like to clone the project to run locally on your machine, please follow the steps below:

1. Going to the repository on Github
2. Clicking on the "Code" button at the top right
3. The link to be copied will then be displayed
4. In your IDE, ensure you are in the correct directory and then type "git clone" followed by pasting the link
5. The repository will then be cloned into your chosen directory

Once you have the cloned repository ready to go, there are a few more steps to take that are crucial to getting it running locally:

1. Install all the project's dependencies with the command: ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
2. Create a file called ```env.py``` - then ```import os``` at the top and add the following variables to it:
    ```python
    os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "your_django_secret_key")
    os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "your_stripe_secret_key")
    os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "your_stripe_public_key")
    os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "your_stripe_webhook_secret")
    ```
3. Ensure that these variables are properly referenced in your project level ```settings.py``` file
4. At this step you can also create a couple of other commented out variables in ```env.py``` for later on that are necessary to deploy the project: 
    ```python
    os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "for_your_postgres_database")
    os.environ.setdefault("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "for_your_amazon_aws_access_key_id")
    os.environ.setdefault("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "for_your_amazon_secret_access_key")
    ```
5. Ensure that your ```env.py``` file is in your ```.gitignore``` file so no secret keys are exposed

Now you'll need to make sure that the database files are ready by using the following commands (**in the order listed below**) in the terminal:

1. ```python3 manage.py makemigrations```
2. ```python3 manage.py migrate```

The app is nearly good to run locally. Next create a superuser so you can log into the admin section with ```python3 manage.py createsuperuser``` and finally start the server with ```python3 manage.py runserver```

If Port 8000 is running you should be able to launch the app in your browser. Be sure to make the port public if you want to start testing Stripe Webhooks.
